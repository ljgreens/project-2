# Important Notes about Running this Script:
# 1. This script was developed and run on the following OS and machine:
#    Machine: Lenovo T460s (upgraded)
#    Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7300U CPU @ 2.60GHz   
#    Installed Ram: 16.0 GB (15.8 GB usable)
#    Operating System: Windows 10 Pro
#        64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
#    R Version: R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23 ucrt)
# 2. The total run-time for this script on the above hardware, not counting
#    installation of any required packages, is approximately 2 minutes to 
#    run all and 30 seconds to knit to pdf
# 3. Any of the libraries listed in the `package-inclusion-installation` are
#    installed beforehand using if(!require) statements
# 5. Functions have not been used for repetitive coding operations due 
#    the marking rubric requesting code that "runs easily, [and] is easy to 
#    follow".  For that reason, the code is written in script form
# 6. Vignettes used to facilitate code development are referenced in APA
# 7. Three hash tags identifies comments that provide a high level explanation of
#    what the code is producing
# 8. One hash tag identifies comments that are specific to what a few lines
#    of code are producing
# 9. Blocked header comments are included to describe general processes
# 10. If asked to restart R session for install of libraries, select no;
#     after the libraries are installed, R will need to be closed and reopened
#     and the script will need to be run again.  This is particularly the case
#     for the tidyverse because of all the additional libraries it uses; was
#     a bit finicky during testing

# Introduction

Machine learning continues to become more prevalent in daily life.  For
example, despite having a search function, Amazon uses recommender systems to 
ease the information overload of having millions of products to choose from,
so that online shopping is more enjoyable and sales are positively impacted.  In
addition, traffic predictions are made from GPS navigation position and 
velocity information, which are loaded into real-time maps to visualize 
predicted areas of congestion, which can help reduce commute times 
(Daffodil Software, 2017).  Furthermore, machine learning can also bring value
to the medical field.

For this project, the Vertebral Column Data Set (Mota et al., 2011) from
the University of California's Machine Learning Repository was used to develop 
a preliminary framework for assessing the potential of machine learning 
solutions for use in future medical image augmentation systems.  This 
Vertebral Column Data Set contains six anatomical predictors derived from 
lumbar spine and pelvis relationships that were measured from medical imagery, 
three associated lumbar spine classification types, and 310 patient 
records.  More specifically, each of the 310 patient records contain measures of 
Pelvic Incidence (PI), Pelvic tilt (PT), Lumbar Lordosis (LL), Sacral Slope 
(SS), Pelvic Radius (PR), and Spondylolisthesis Grade (SG).  In total, the 
310 patients consist of 100 Normal (NO) classes, 60 Disk Hernia (DH) classes,
and 150 Spondylolisthesis (SL) classes.  

For this supervised machine learning exercise, a number of key steps were 
performed in pursuit achieving the goal of producing a machine learning solution
that could be considered for use in a future machine learning medical image
augmentation system.  These steps included data acquisition; data preparation;
data cleaning; data splitting into a training, test, and verification data 
set; data exploration and data visualization; a modeling approach; and model
fitting which incorporated cross-validation along with parameter tuning for 
some of the models.  After model cross-validation and parameter tuning was 
complete, the classification solutions were applied to the verification data 
set, and the results were assessed using metrics derived from the confusion
matrix to determine suitability as imaging augmentation information.  Overall, 
a mean score of 0.70 computed from balanced accuracy, F1-Score, and precision 
was set as a threshold to be met or exceeded for the machine learning class 
prediction to achieve the goal of being considered for implementation 
within a future medical image augmentation system.

# Methods and Analysis

In general, data science projects require the identification of patterns and 
trends within data and other important data characteristics, all of which 
tell a story.  Using R, a programming language with origins in
statistical computation and graphics (The R Foundation, n.d.), these noteworthy 
insights are communicated throughout, and ultimately, these insights
guided the model selection and development.

## Data Aquisition

Initially, the Vertebral Column Data Set (Mota et al., 2011) was obtained from 
the University of California's Machine Learning Repository through an automated 
download and in-memory storage of R objects, which were created from 
the downloaded data. As the foundation of the data download and storage, a
previous script supplied by the course team for the HarvardX Professional 
Certificate in Data Science (Irizarry, n.d.) was used as vignette and modified 
as needed to complete the task.  Within the downloaded data, there were two
data sets: one binary classification data set, and the three class data set 
described in the introduction with the file name column_3C.dat that was used 
here.  To conform to the recommendations of this project, the column_3C.dat
file was loaded to the author's GitHub repository, where the process to obtain
the data now is to download the data from the GitHub repository.  Should the
GitHub repository be unavailable, then the data download reverts back to the
University of California's Machine Learning Repository.  With the data 
downloaded and accessible, further data preparation tasks were undertaken.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation is an important first step in any data science project 
(Wickham, 2014).  Upon initial inspection, the Vertebral Column Data Set 
(Mota et al., 2011) is consistent with the characteristics of Tidy Data, 
where every row is an observation, every column is a variable, and any
observational units are independent tables (Wickham, 2014).  The rationale for
working with Tidy Data comes from the increased ease with which data modeling, 
data manipulating, and data visualization can be achieved (Wickham, 2014).
Because the data was tidy upon acquisition, little data preparation was 
required with the exception of providing meaningful column names for the 
predictors and classes.

The following table displays six randomly sampled rows from the Vertebral 
Column Data Set:

```

## Data Cleaning

A reliable analysis and repeatable results are difficult to attain if the input
data has errors and omissions.  For example, missing values in a data set 
that are zero when zero is not representative of the feature can result in a 
mean that is biased, and machine learning algorithms may fail to train or 
produce reliable solutions on data that is missing values.

To ensure the Vertebral Column Data was free from the pitfalls that data error 
and omissions create, all columns of the data set were tested for NA values. 
The search for NA data within the Vertebral Column Data Set was achieved by 
counting the number of NA values present in each predictor and each 
classification.  This NA count information is summarized in the table below:


``` {r, na-investigation, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

for(i in 1:nrow(dataInspection)) {
  dataInspection[i, "Column"] <- rowNames[i]
  dataInspection[i,"NA_Count"] <- length(which(is.na(orthoData[,i])))
}

# Change the column names for display in the table for output
colnames(dataInspection) <- c("Column", "NA Count")

# Build and display table using knitr vignette

knitr::kable(dataInspection,
             booktabs = TRUE,
             longtable = TRUE,
             linesep = "",
             row.names = FALSE,
             caption = "Counts of NA Values Within Vertebral Column Data Set") %>%

                position = "center",
                font_size = 8) 

```

Seeing that the Vertebral Column Data was free of NA values, the next data
cleaning step focused on data type verification, and confirming that 
the anatomical predictor values are representative of geometric measures.
The data type for each predictor are summarized in the following 
table, along with the predictor range expressed as the minimum and maximum 
values:

``` {r, data-class-range, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Build a table to display the class of each column within the 
### Vertebral Column Data Set

# Create an empty data frame to hold the class values for each column of the
# Vertebral Column Data Set

# Loop through all of the orthoData data frame column names and extract the
# class of the column, which is written to the `columnClass` data frame
for(i in 1:ncol(orthoData)) {
  columnData[i, 1] <- columnNames[i]
  columnData[i, 2] <- class(orthoData[,i])
  if(class(orthoData[,i]) != "numeric"){
    columnData[i, 3] <- NA
    columnData[i, 4] <- NA
  } else {
    columnData[i, 3] <- min(orthoData[,i])
    columnData[i, 4] <- max(orthoData[,i])
  }
}

# Provided updated display names for the columnData dat fram for display
# in the following table
columnDataNames <- c("Column Name", "Class", "Minimum", "Maximum")
colnames(columnData) <- columnDataNames

# Build and display table using knitr vignette 
# (Xie et. al., 2022, Chapter 10; Pileggi, 2022; Zhu, 2021)
knitr::kable(columnData,
             booktabs = TRUE,
             longtable = TRUE,
             linesep = "",
             row.names = FALSE,
             caption = "Vertebral Column Data Set Metadata") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped"), 
                position = "center",
                font_size = 8) 


```

Because Pelvic Incidence, Pelvic Tilt, Lumbar Lordosis, Sacral Slope,
Pelvic Radius, and Spondylolisthesis Grade are measured anatomical 
values, their numeric class is a valid representation.  Although Pelvic 
Incidence, Pelvic Tilt, Lumbar Lordosis, Sacral Slope, and Pelvic Radius 
appear to be within reasonable ranges, Spondylolisthesis Grade stood out
based on the connection of the name to the Meyerding Classification System
(Koslosky & Gendelberg, 2020), which suggested that it may be a 
class instead of a predictor.  Within the Meyerding Classification
System, the degree of slip between vertebrae obtained from medical imagery
is provided as a percentage (Koslosky & Gendelberg, 2020); more precisely,

|     [t]he grade percent is determined by drawing a line through the posterior
|     wall of the superior and inferior vertebral bodies and measuring the
|     translation of the superior vertebral body as a percentage of the distance
|     between the two lines. (Koslosky & Gendelberg, 2020) 

However, the minimum value of `r min(orthoData$spondylolisthesisGrade)` and 
maximum value of `r max(orthoData$spondylolisthesisGrade)` affirm that the 
Meyerding Classification System was not the unit of measure for 
Spondylolisthesis Grade within the Vertebral Column Data set because of the 
negative values.  For reference, the Meyerding Classification System grades 
and percentages are shown in the following table:

``` {r, meyerding-classification-table, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

(Koslosky & Gendelberg, 2020)

Even though the physical interpretation of the Spondylolisthesis Grade measure 
in the Vertebral Column Data Set was unknown, since the Vertebral Column values 
for Spondylolisthesis Grade were not Meyerding Classifications and 
the predictor definitions within the University of California's Machine Learning
Repository identified Spondylolisthesis Grade as an attribute (not class), 
they were deemed to be valid for use as predictors.

As the last data check before moving forward with data exploration and data
visualization, Le Huec et al. (2011) reveals the relationship between Pelvic 
Incidence (PI), Pelvic Tilt (PT), and Sacral Slope (SS) as shown in the 
following equation:

\[PI = PT + SS\]

As described by the equation above, the sum of the Pelvic Tilt and Sacral Slope 
from the Vertebral Column Data Set should match the Pelvic Incidence from the 
Vertebral Column Data Set within a reasonable margin of error, considering that
Pelvic Tilt and Sacral Slope are measured values and measurements are random 
variables with uncertainty.  The following table displays a random sample of the 
difference between the computed Pelvic Incidence and the Pelvic Incidence 
provided within the Vertebral Column Data Set:

From the six random samples shown in the table above, the differences in 
the Vertebral Column Data Set Pelvic Incidence and the computed Pelvic 
Incidence were zero or close to zero. However, the table shows only six of
the 310 differences. To further explore the Pelvic Incidence verification 
results, the following summary statistics of the difference between the 
Vertebral Column Data Set Pelvic Incidence and the computed Pelvic Incidence
(Delta_PI) are presented in the table below:

With a range of -0.01 to 0.01 and a mean difference between the Vertebral 
Column Data Set Pelvic Incidence and the computed Pelvic Incidence of 
`r summary_df$Mean`, the Vertebral Column Data Set predictors of Pelvic 
Incidence, Pelvic Tilt, and Sacral slope were deemed to be reliable for
machine learning purposes.

Overall, the Vertebral Column Data downloaded from the University of 
California's Machine Learning Repository did not require additional 
modification to transform it to a Tidy Data set, nor did it require additional 
cleaning.  With the integrity of Vertebral Column Data Set confirmed, the 
data was ready to be split into training, test, and validation subsets. 

## Data Splitting

In general, very large data sets and very small data sets present their own
machine learning challenges. Although large data sets offer the benefit of 
creating training, test, and verification data where class prevalence
disparity can be eliminated, managing memory and having adequate processing 
power can be difficult to achieve.  Conversely, small data sets require 
little memory management and computing power to implement computationally 
expensive methods, but bias due to prevalence of the classes within the data 
set can exist within the split data and be transferred to the machine learning 
solutions, which can cloud the results.  Since the Vertebral Column Data Set is
small, with only `r nrow(orthoData)` patient classifications and their 
associated predictors, key to producing reliable results required a strategic 
data splitting methodology.

Based on the size of the Vertebral Column Data Set, the Law of Large Numbers 
and the Central Limit Theorem can help guide the data splitting process.
More specifically, the Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of 
observations increases, the standard error decreases and the mean of the 
observations becomes closer to the true mean (Irizzary, 2022, 
Chapter 14).  In addition, the Central Limit Theorem states that large sample 
sizes result in a normal distribution (Irizarry, 2022, Chapter 14), which is an 
fundamental requirement of many machine learning methods and
a requirement for reliable statistical properties of the predictors.  Often,
30 observations will produce data that is normal, and sometimes as little
as 10 observations will suffice (Irizarry, 2022, Chapter 14).

To test the application of the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Large 
Numbers to the Vertebral Column Data set, a Monte Carlo Simulation 
could be preformed on each of the training, test, and validation set 
predictors to reveal the statistical stability of the sample means 
and standard errors of those means (Irizarry, 2022).  Alternatively, histograms
and QQ-Plots are visualization tools that can be used to asses the 
normality of a sample, which is the method that was used to test the 
training data normality in the following data exploration and data visualization
section.

Unfortunately, the data size did not allow for class prevalence correction 
during data splitting while still maintaining enough data in each split to 
produce normally distributed predictors.  Therefore, 155 rows, one half of 
each class of the raw data, was split out of the Vertebral Column Data into 
a training data set and a verification data set.  To complete the data 
splitting, the training set was again split approximately in half to contain 
77 to 78 observations of training and test data with approximately the 
same class structure as the verification data.  In addition, based on the 
knowledge of class prevalence presented in the introduction and the discussion
thus far, class prevalence disparity is expected.  Therefore, the sample 
function was selected instead of the caret package's createDataPartition 
function to split the data into training, test, and verification data 
sets because the createDataPartition function attempts to create data splits 
that are somewhat statistically similar (Dalpaiz, 2020, Chapter 21).  Yet, the 
goal is to limit the statistical similarity of the data between the splits 
while maintaining the same class structure, so that biases have as little 
transference as possible within the split data.  In other words, the sample 
function is preferable based on the prevalence of classes in the data set 
because the sampling of each class will be random, which should increase the 
likelihood that the final algorithm can generalize better to new data and 
help mitigate the expected bias.

As noted, as many patient records as possible were kept instead of splitting 
the data into even smaller sets to correct for class prevalence.  This approach
was necessary to increase the likelihood that the training, test, and 
verification data would be normally distributed, and therefore, specific 
machine learning methods that require normally distributed data would not be 
excluded from use.  Fortunately, even the performance of methods with bias 
in the data where normality has been preserved by using all of the data, 
such as this case, can still be reasonably assessed using specific metrics 
that include, balanced accuracy and F1-Score, because those metrics have the
ability to account for the class prevalence bias (Olugbenga, 2023).  
Consequently, determining the best performing method is possible using the 
entire data set, while retaining as many machine learning methods to choose 
from.  Still, caution must be exercised given the possibility that class 
prevalence bias could jeopardize the ability of the solution to generalize to 
new data.  

To summarize the data splitting technique, all records were kept to provide
the best chance for predictors to follow a normal distribution, which helped 
qualify the split data for use within a variety of machine learning 
algorithms that require normal data.  In addition, the sample function was 
used over the createDataPartition function to assist in mitigating the 
class prevalence bias within the Vertebral Column Data Set, yet bias is still 
expected to persist in the training, test, and verification data to an unknown 
degree.  The following table provides the class counts that were used to 
construct the training and verification data sets:

## Data Exploration and Visualization

Data exploration and data visualization are used throughout this project to 
assist in constructing, improving, and refining models that predict
Vertebral Column Data patient classes.  More specifically, the model 
development follows an iterative analysis and visualization process on the 
training data set.  Ultimately, this process provided the insights that 
guided the model development and model fitting.

### Training Data Predictor Summary Statistics and Histograms

To begin the data exploration and visualization process, summary statistics and 
histograms were prepared for each predictor in the training data set. 
A few of the many reasons why summary statistics and histograms are useful in
preliminary data analysis is that the distribution, measures of variability, 
and measures of central tendency (Irizarry, 2022, Chapter 12) can be determined.
In turn, these statistics and data visualizations can lead to insights that
drive machine learning method selection, greater understanding of the data,
and how it can potentially be used.  The following table presents summary 
statistics of the minimum, first quartile, median,	mean,	third 
quartile, and	maximum values for each predictor within the training data:

             linesep = "",

To generate the summary statistics presented in the table above, the base R 
summary function was used.  With the exception of Spondylolisthesis Grade, the
mean and median are reasonably close for all predictors, which suggests that 
all predictors but Spondylolisthesis Grade follow a normal distribution. 
Although the first and third quartiles are provided, which gives an idea of the
where 75 percent of the data for each predictor in the training data lies, 
greater insight into the distribution of each predictor was achieved by 
producing histograms of each predictor as displayed in the following plot grid:

``` {r, histogram-display, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Use the library(cowplot) to combine and create a layout for the histogram
### plots of each predictor in the training data, vignette Wilke (2022)
plot_grid(piHist, ptHist, llHist, ssHist, prHist, sgHist, ncol = 2, nrow = 3)

```

The ggplot package was used to generate the histogram objects using 
geom_histogram with the number of bins set to 10.  The number of bins
was set to 10 to attain a general idea (not coarse, not fine) of the predictor 
distribution.  Consistent with the mean and median comparison of the predictors 
made using the summary statistics, the predictors are appear to follow a normal 
distribution with some shifts in central tendency, but without any
substantial skew, except for Spondylolisthesis Grade.  However, a QQ-plot 
would provide a better visual frame to evaluate the degree of predictor 
normality.

### Degree of Predictor Normality 

As shown in the predictor histograms derived from the training data,
with the exception of the Spondylolisthesis Grade, the predictors, overall,
present with characteristics that would fit a normal curve (Gaussian 
distribution). However, more insight into the suitability of the predictors to 
be used in models such as Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), a method that 
requires predictors to be bivariate normal, could be gained by assessing
the degree of normality with at least two independent samples of the data.
Since QQ-plots are useful for comparing a set of data to the mathematical 
normal distribution (Irizarry, 2022, Chapter 12), QQ-plots
of each predictor should provide the normality assessment desired.  The 
following QQ-plot shows each predictor compared to the mathematical Normal 
distribution:

``` {r, qqplot-normal, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Create a QQ-Plot of all predictors in the same plot to visualize their
### relationship to a Normal Distribution.

# Create vector to hold the measures and predictor geometry which will be used
# to display the qq-plot of the measures and color by geometry type within

colnames(SG) <- measureDataNames

# single data frame to plot using ggplot

# of each predictor in the training data set
ggplot(data = measureData, aes(sample = Measure, color = Geometry)) + 
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Training Data Normality Assessment of Predictors Using QQ-Plot") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Predictor"))


```

Confirming what the histograms and summary statistics presented, the 
predictors more or less follow a normal distribution with the exception of 
Spondylolisthesis Grade.  In assessing the degree of normality for the predictors 
other than Spondylolisthesis Grade, visually, Pelvic Incidence had the largest
number of points with the shortest distance to its best fit line, and Pelvic
Tilt visually has the greatest number of points with the largest distance to
its best fit line.  Therefore, Pelvic Incidence shows the greatest degree of 
normality, Pelvic Tilt shows the least degree of normality, and Pelvic Radius, 
Lumbar Lordosis, and Sacral Slope fall somewhere in between.  Consequently, 
Pelvic Incidence should have the greatest acceptance from machine learning 
methods that require normally distributed predictors, and Pelvic Tilt should 
be the least acceptable.  

Regardless, of the suitability of a predictor for a particular machine 
learning method, the utility of the predictors within a machine learning method
depends on their variability (Irizarry, n.d).  Despite being able to discern 
some variability from the histograms, the base R summary function that was 
used to provide summary statistic information did not provide an important
measure of variability: standard deviation.  Therefore, the variability of the
predictors required further exploration because predictors with high 
variability often have greater importance and predictive power in machine
learning, whereas predictors with low variability may provide little 
information to potentially enhance model performance (Irizarry, n.d).

### Predictor Variability

As stated in the Degree of Normality section, more variability in a predictor 
implies that the predictor may provide more machine learning utility. 
Therefore, the following table and plot summarizes the variability of each 
predictor, so that initial interpretations of predictive power can be assessed:

``` {r, predictor-variability, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Predictor variability data exploration and visualization

# Create an empty data frame as a matrix sized for the predictor train data set
predictorVariability <- data.frame(matrix(nrow = ncol(train)-1, ncol = 2))

# Provide names based on the number of columns set with the create and 
# cast matrix to data frame line above
predictorVariabilityNames <- c("predictor", "standardDeviation")
colnames(predictorVariability) <- predictorVariabilityNames

# Extract the names of the training data data frame
predictorNames <- names(train)

# Apply the predictor names from the predictorNames object and the
# associated standard deviation of the predictor to the predictorVariability
# data frame which will be used to display a predictor variability table and
# a predictor variability bar plot to compare the predictor variability
for(i in 1:ncol(train)-1) {
  predictorVariability[i, "predictor"] <- predictorNames[i]
  predictorVariability[i, "standardDeviation"] <- sd(train[,i])
}

# Build and display table using knitr vignette 
# (Xie et. al., 2022, Chapter 10; Pileggi, 2022; Zhu, 2021)
knitr::kable(predictorVariability,
             booktabs = TRUE,
             longtable = TRUE,
             linesep = "",
             row.names = FALSE,
             caption = "Variability of Predictors") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped"), 
                position = "center",
                font_size = 8) 

# Quick barplot of the standard deviation of the predictors
barplot(predictorVariability$standardDeviation,
        main = "Standard Deviation of Predictors",
        xlab = "Predictor",
        ylab = "Standard Deviation",
        names.arg = c("PI", "PT", "LL", "SS", "PR", "SG"))


```

The predictors of Pelvic Incidence, Pelvic Tilt, Lumbar Lordosis, 
Sacral Slope, and Pelvic Radius have comparable variability.  However,
as the histogram above shows, Spondylolisthesis Grade on average has 
nearly twice the variability as all other predictors, which suggests 
Spondylolisthesis Grade should prove valuable when used in machine 
learning methods.  Unfortunately, the QQ-plot revealed that Spondylolisthesis
Grade is not normally distributed, and therefore, only machine learning 
methods that do not consider predictor distribution or do not require normally
distributed predictors are valid to use with Spondylolisthesis Grade.

## Modeling Approach and Model Building

The foregoing data splitting and data exploration and visualization sections 
identified important characteristics and insights attributed to the Vertebral
Column Data set that can be leveraged to guide the modeling approach and model
construction.  In summary, those insights are as follows:  

* Although Spondylolisthesis Grade has the most variability out of all  
predictors, which from a preliminary perspective suggests that it may be one 
of the most useful predictors, it can be applied only in machine learning
methods that do not consider the predictor distribution or do not require
normally distributed predictors, since the QQ-plot revealed Spondylolisthesis
Grade is not normally distributed.

* Despite attempting to implement a data splitting strategy that 
mitigates class prevalence bias in the training, test, and verification data,
a balance was struck between mitigating the degree of bias by sampling the 
Vertebral Column Data Set instead of using createDataPartition, and using
all of the patient records to help ensure that the predictors follow a normal 
distribution, so that machine learning methods were not eliminated from 
available options due to some method's requirement for normally distributed data.

* Despite the disadvantages of the small size of the data set for producing
a prediction platform that would generalize well to new data, with such a small
amount of data, baseline results can be skipped.  Instead, each model can
immediately be cross-validated on the training data and tested on the test 
data to assess the models ability to generalize to new data.  In addition, 
computationally expensive models were not ruled out when selecting models 
to train, cross-validate, test, and verify because the time and computing power
required should be minimal given the small data set size. 

Based on the foregoing insights, characteristics of an ideal 
model for the Vertebral Column Data Set includes models that do not consider 
predictor distribution, and models that can accommodate for the class prevalence 
bias that is presumed to be inherent within the Vertebral Column Data Set 
and transferred to the training, test, and validation data sets.

Fortunately, the caret package contains a large number of supervised 
classification machine learning methods to choose from.  In addition, the caret
package makes working with the packages easy due to standardized function 
calls (Kuhn, 2019).  Overall, the models selected to predicted patient 
classifications were determined from exposure to models from Irizarry's 
machine learning course (n.d.), the documentation provided in the caret 
repository (Kuhn, 2019), and the insights obtained from the data splitting
and data exploration and data visualization sections.  Based on this 
information, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forest, and 
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) methods were chosen to generate cross-validated 
predictions of patient class while using suitable predictors for each method.

\newpage

### Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

Before starting the prediction process with QDA, which is a version of Naive 
Bayes where the predictors are assumed to be multivariate normal
(Irizarry, 2022, Chapter 31), the data splitting was performed multiple times 
by re-running the computation script without setting a seed value, so the split
data was randomly sampled.  Although the results of script re-runs are not 
shown here, by randomly sampling the Vertebral Column data 
multiple times to generate variations of the training data and analyzing the 
summary statistics, histograms, and QQ-plots for the predictors, the predictors 
with the exception of Spondylolisthesis Grade were determined to be 
multivariate normal.  In addition, seeing that class prevalence bias is 
expected within the training data due to unequal distribution of patient 
classifications, QDA was an attractive method because Naive Bayes controls
for prevalence (Irizarry, 2022, Chapter 31).  The table and histogram
below provide a reminder of the class prevalence within the training data set:


``` {r, classification-prevalence, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Show the class prevalence of the train data classes based on the counts
### of each class

# Create class prevalence data frame the summarizes the counts of each 
# training data class
classificationPrevalence <- train %>% group_by(diseaseClassification) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

# Build and display table using knitr vignette 
# (Xie et. al., 2022, Chapter 10; Pileggi, 2022; Zhu, 2021)
knitr::kable(classificationPrevalence,
             booktabs = TRUE,
             longtable = TRUE,
             linesep = "",
             row.names = FALSE,
             caption = "Training Data Class Prevalence") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped"), 
                position = "center",
                font_size = 8) 

# Quick barplot of the Disease Prevalence in the training data
barplot(classificationPrevalence$count,
        main = "Training Data Class Prevalence",
        xlab = "Disease",
        ylab = "Count",
        names.arg = c(classificationPrevalence$diseaseClassification))


```

\newpage

Considering the small size of the training data set, the potential to over fit 
the model was also assessed.  The following formula was used to determine the 
estimated number of parameters required for the QDA solution, which was used to 
understand the over fitting risk:

\[Parameters = K \left[\frac{2p + p(p-1)}{2}\right]\]

where, 

\[K = the \: number \: of \: classes\]
\[p = the \: number \: of \: predictors\]

(Irizarry, n.d.)

To assess the prospect of over fitting, the closer the number of parameters 
is to the size of the data set, the higher the risk of over fitting, which is 
also know as the curse of dimensionality; as the number of parameters increases
and approaches the number of data set records, the utility of the method
declines (Irizarry, 2022, Chapter 31).

For the Vertebral Column Data Set, the following table shows the estimated 
number of computed parameters required for QDA to operate with three 
classes of DH, SL, and NO, and using a range of predictors sequentially added to
the model, which include, Pelvic Incidence, Pelvic Tilt, Lumbar Lordosis, 
Sacral Slope, and Pelvic Radius:

``` {r, qda-parameters, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Estimate the parameters required to run the QDA machine learning method
### These estimates are create based on the number of classes within the
### Vertebral Column Data set and the number of predictors to be included
### for training a QDA model.  Results are then used to determine if enough
### degree of freedom remains so the model does not over fit

# Create a vector to hold the number of predictors to estimate parameters
predictorsUsed <- 1:5

# Set the value of K to hold the number of classes within the Vertebral
# Column Data Set
K <- nrow(classificationPrevalence)

# Create an empty data frame cast from a matrix to hold the number of 
# compute parameters estimated to run QDA
parametersRequired <- data.frame(matrix(nrow = length(predictorsUsed), ncol = 3))
parametersRequiredNames <- c("predictorsUsed", "classesK", "parametersRequired")
colnames(parametersRequired) <- parametersRequiredNames

# Make the estimated required parameters for each class and number of predictors
# combination and store the results to the parameters required data frame
for(i in 1:nrow(parametersRequired)) {
  parametersRequired[i, "predictorsUsed"] <- predictorsUsed[i]
  parametersRequired[i, "classesK"] <- K
  parametersRequired[i, "parametersRequired"] <- K*((2*predictorsUsed[i] + predictorsUsed[i]*(predictorsUsed[i]-1))/2)
}

# Build and display table using knitr vignette 
# (Xie et. al., 2022, Chapter 10; Pileggi, 2022; Zhu, 2021)
knitr::kable(parametersRequired,
             booktabs = TRUE,
             longtable = TRUE,
             linesep = "",
             row.names = FALSE,
             caption = "Estimated QDA Parameter Requirements") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped"), 
                position = "center",
                font_size = 8) 

```

From the table above, if all predictors represented by bivariate normal data 
are used in the QDA model, an estimated 45 parameters are required.  Since there 
are `r nrow(train)` observations, there is still plenty of freedom left within
the training data set, so over fitting was not expected be a problem.
Therefore, QDA was applied to the training data using 5-fold cross-validation
and the following five bivariate normal predictors: Pelvic Incidence, 
Pelvic Tilt, Lumbar Lordosis, Sacral Slope, and Pelvic Radius.


``` {r, apply-qda, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

### QDA Fitting and Accuracy Generation from Confusion Matrix Output

# Vignette on cross validation (Dalpaiz, 2020, Chapter 21)
# perform the cross validation on the training set with 5 folds 
train_qda <- train(diseaseClassification ~ pelvicIncidence 
                   + pelvicTilt
                   + lumbarLordosis
                   + sacralSlope
                   + pelvicRadius,
                   method = "qda",
                   trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5),
                   data = train)

# Create object to hold the confuction matrix accuracy from cross-validation
qdaAccuracy <- confusionMatrix(predict(train_qda, test),
                factor(test$diseaseClassification))$overall["Accuracy"]

```

In the context of patient classification, the accuracy of `r round(qdaAccuracy,3)` 
achieved by QDA left room for improvement.  Perhaps, because Pelvic 
Incidence is a function of Pelvic Tilt and Sacral Slope, as noted in the data 
cleaning section, where $PI = PT + SS$, duplicate information may not be
providing a performance boost, or those predictors simply could have very 
little impact to the accuracy of the QDA solution.  To explore whether Pelvic 
Incidence, Pelvic Tilt and Sacral Slope had importance in patient class 
predictions (along with the other predictors in the Vertebral Column Data Set),
the variable importance feature of the Random Forest method presented the 
opportunity to quantify predictor classification value. 

### Random Forest

Besides providing insight regarding the importance of predictors and being
a method that is an extension of decision trees that elegantly escapes the curse
of dimensionality that QDA is subject to (Irizarry, 2022, Chapter 31), the 
decision trees associated with Random Forests are also useful in medical 
diagnostics.  According to Podgorelec et al. (2002), decision trees can be 
reliable, effective, and accurate in medical decision making.  With the 
premise of escaping the curse of dimensionality and the relevance of decision 
trees in medical decision making, Random Forest was implemented using all of 
the predictors available and five-fold cross-validation to provide an accuracy
comparative to QDA, and to gain insight into the predictors that provide 
the most and least utility. 

``` {r, apply-random-forest, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

### Random Forest Fitting and Accuracy Generation from Confusion Matrix Output

# Vignette on cross validation (Dalpaiz, 2020, Chapter 21)
# perform the cross validation on the training set with 5 folds 
train_rf <- train(diseaseClassification ~ .,
                   method = "rf",
                   trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5),
                   data = train)

# Create variable importance object to be used to summarize the predictor utility
rfImportance <- varImp(train_rf)

# Create object to hold the confuction matrix accuracy from cross-validation
rfAccuracy <- confusionMatrix(predict(train_rf, test),
                factor(test$diseaseClassification))$overall["Accuracy"]


```

The Random Forest method improved the accuracy of the model from 
`r round(qdaAccuracy,3)` to `r round(rfAccuracy,3)`, and as expected, provided 
insight into the importance of the predictors.  A summary of the variable 
importance generated from the Random Forest method is shown in the bar plot 
and table below:


``` {r, variable-importance-random-forest-1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

Not surprising, Spondylolisthesis Grade presents with overwhelming importance
compared to the other predictors.  However, the substantial importance may 
simply be due to the class prevalence bias within the training data set, or it
may be legitimate since Spondylolisthesis Grade had, on average, twice the 
variability of any other predictor, which implies its ability to provide useful
classification information.  To confirm, the importance of Spondylolisthesis 
Grade could be verified as over-valued if data sets with different class 
prevalence were used to compare variable importance results.

Nevertheless, Random Forest and the standard deviation comparison in the
Predictor Variability section did show that Spondylolisthesis Grade is an 
important predictor.  Therefore, since Spondylolisthesis Grade was identified
as an important predictor and QDA was not able to take advantage of 
Spondylolisthesis Grade because the predictor does not meet QDA's 
requirement of being bivariate normal, K-Nearest Neighbors was 
implemented next as a comparative to Random Forest because KNN is a 
non-parametric classifier, which means KNN does not consider predictor
distribution (Speck, 2017).

### K-Nearest Neighbors

Despite KNN being immune from having to rely on data following a specific 
distribution, KNN comes with its own challenges.  First of all, a major 
challenge with KNN (as with QDA), is the curse of dimensionality (Speck, 
2017; Irizarry, 2022, Chapter 31).  Fortunately, the variable importance derived 
from the five fold cross-validated Random Forest model helped identify 
predictors that should add value to the KNN solution.  Based on predictor 
importance being predetermined, overcoming potential over fitting using KNN
was protected against by using the most important predictor first, and 
then adding the next most important predictor, and so on.  With this approach, 
the anticipated outcome was to find a balance between avoiding over fitting 
and optimizing the KNN method, where each KNN model added the next
most important predictor, was cross-validated, and the smoothing window (K) was 
tuned.

Before the models could be assessed, a metric to compare the various KNN models
was needed.  Assessing the fit was selected because fit can be evaluated as 
over, under, or best.  Models that are over fit and under fit can be identified
by comparing the test accuracy of various models and individual model training
and test accuracy in conjunction with model complexity (Dalpaiz, 2020; Dalpaiz, 
2022).  In general, a  model is over fit when the test accuracy is less than 
the train accuracy; a model is under fit when the test accuracy is greater 
than the train accuracy, yet, not the best performing model; and the best 
fit model has a test accuracy that is greater than the train accuracy while 
being the least complex out of all under trained models (Dalpaiz, 2020; Dalpaiz,
2022).

The following plot shows the cross-validation and tuning process for a variety 
of smoothing values (K) used during the KNN model building process of adding
the next most important predictor per iteration.  In addition, the following 
table summarizes the predictors used; the best tune for K; the accuracy attained
for the training data and test data; and a fit result of over, under, or 
best:

Based on the foregoing definitions of fit, the best performing KNN model used
predictors of Spondylolisthesis Grade (SG), Sacral Slope (SS), Pelvic Radius 
(PR), Pelvic Incidence (PI), and Pelvic Tilt (PT), but did not use Lumbar 
Lordosis, since the Random Forest variable importance reported Lumbar Lordosis
to have zero contribution.  Going forward, this best performing KNN model will
be referred to as the KNN-5 model.

# Results

Often in supervised machine learning classification, accuracy can be used as a
general approach to access model performance, but it can be deceptive, 
particularly when some classes have greater prevalence than others 
(Irizarry, n.d.).  Instead, a confusion matrix provides substantial information 
in grid form that can be used to assess solution performance.  To better 
understand confusion matrices, the following image and definitions are provided.

Occurs when a negative sample is classified incorrectly as a positive (Kundu, 2023). 

**False Negative (FN)** 

Occurs when a positive sample is classified incorrectly as a negative (Kundu, 2023).

In addition, confusion matrix parameters can be used to compute other 
performance measures (Dalpaiz, 2022, Chapter 17).  Of these available metrics,
the following measures have been selected based on their connection to 
overall model performance, relevance for data sets that have class prevalence 
bias, and meaning to the medical field in terms of the cost of errors
(Irizarry, n.d.).  

**Accuracy**

The proportion between correct classifications and total classifications (Irizarry, n.d.): 

\[Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN} {TP+FN+FP+TN}\]

(Olugbenga, 2023)

As noted previously, accuracy can be deceptive, particularly when 
some classes have greater prevalence than others (Irizarry, n.d.).  For 
instance, in a binary classification where one class represents 90 percent of 
the observations, with random guessing an imbalance in accuracy between the 
two classes occurs simply because there is more of one class and less of 
another (Irizarry, n.d.), which makes accuracy misleading for model to model 
comparison and assessment.  Fortunately, other metrics derived from confusion 
matrix values are not clouded by class prevalence, such as studying sensitivity 
and specificity individually, using balanced accuracy, or using F1-Score 
(Irizarry, n.d.).

**Sensitivity**

The algorithms ability to make a positive prediction when the true value is
positive; in other words $\hat Y = True \:, when \: Y = True$,
which is also known as the True Positive Rate (TPR), or Recall (Irizarry, n.d.):

\[Sensitivity = \frac{TP} {TP+FN}\]

(Irizarry, n.d.)

**Specificity**

The algorithms ability to make a negative prediction when the true value is 
negative; in other words $\hat Y = False \:, when \: Y = False$, and is also
known as the True Negative Rate (TNR) (Irizarry, n.d.):

\[Specificity = \frac{TN} {TN + FP}\]

(Irizarry, n.d.)

Sensitivity and specificity are particularly important to evaluate individually
in the context of the cost of error in medicine.  For example, failing to 
diagnose cancer when cancer is present (poor sensitivity) could result in end 
of life, whereas diagnosing cancer when cancer is not present (poor specificity)
is not ideal due to the side effects of chemotherapy drugs used in cancer 
treatment, but the consequence is less costly than poor sensitivity, which
could result in death. 

**Precision**

The ratio of positive predictions derived from the positive class, also known
as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the accuracy of the True
Positive (TP) (Olugbenga, 2023).  

\[Precision = \frac{TP} {TP + FP}\]

(Irizarry, n.d.)

An important note about precision is its relationship to prevalence.  Because
precision depends on prevalence, higher precision can be achieved even when
guessing (Irizarry, n.d.).

\newpage

**Balanced Accuracy**

The mean of sensitivity and specificity (Irizarry, n.d.):

\[Balanced Accuracy = \frac{Sensitivity + Specificity}{2}\]

(Irizarry, n.d.)

Balanced Accuracy is particularly useful when there is class prevalence
imbalance within the data set (Olugbenga, 2023).


**F1-Score**

The harmonic mean of precision and recall (Irizarry, n.d.):

\[F1 = \frac {1} {\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{Recall}+\frac{1}{Precision})}\]

(Irizarry, n.d.)

In addition to F1-Score being useful when a class prevalence imbalance exists 
within a data set (Olugbenga, 2023), it can also be used to independently weight 
precision and recall (Irizarry, n.d.).  In doing so, precision and recall
can be weighted to better the apportion the cost of error given a specific use
case (cancer diagnosis example provided previously), which ultimately allows 
for superior algorithm performance comparisons, and building a framework to 
determine when an algorithm is ready to be deployed.

With the applicable metrics for supervised machine learning classification
defined along with their use, the analysis of the results for QDA, 
Random Forest, and KNN was ready to proceed.  

## Model Performance Comparisons

Based on the expected class prevalence bias in the data and the implications 
of incorrect classifications in medicine, accuracy alone is not enough to 
determine the best performing model.  Yet, accuracy does have value because of 
its ability to provide a general performance assessment, and the ability to 
reveal whether a model over fits, under fits, or is the best fit when applied
to new data.  The following table shows the results of applying the same fit 
assessment methodology used in the Modeling Approach and Model Building section 
that was applied to the various KNN models, which is based on the fit criteria 
established by Dalpaiz (2020; 2021):

Surprising or not, the KNN-5 model appears to be susceptible to the curse of
dimesionality as the KNN-5 model over fit the verification data.  Perhaps not 
surprising, Random Forest performed well because decision trees are 
unaffected by the curse of dimensionality, and as described by Podgorelec et 
al. (2002) can be a reliable method in medicine for diagnosis.  Furthermore, 
since Random Forest was implemented over other decision tree methods such as 
rpart, the solution also escaped the pitfalls of over fitting that decision 
tree packages are susceptible to, but that Random Forest is not 
(Irizarry, n.d.). Overall, because KNN-5 over fit the verification data, and 
therefore, renders the model unreliable for the application to new data, the 
confusion matrix derived performance metrics identified as useful given the 
context and project goal will not be discussed for the KNN-5 model.  Instead, 
the results of QDA and Random Forest became the focus of the results analysis 
because both solutions did not over fit.

Although Random Forest outperformed QDA when considering accuracy only, 
sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, and F1-Score, can provide a more
precise perspective for comparing model performance.  These measures are 
automatically generated by the caret package's confusionMatrix function, and
can easily be extract from the returned object.  The expectation is that 
sensitivity and specificity will provide information as to whether QDA or 
Random Forest results are more suitable for integration into a medical image 
augmentation system for spine classifications, since sensitivity and specificity
are measures of the cost of error (Irizarry, n.d.). Moreover, balanced accuracy 
and F1-Score will provide insight as to whether QDA or Random Forest would 
likely generalize to other future data sets with different class prevalence, 
since balanced accuracy and F1-Score work well for model assessment when 
class prevalence bias is present.  To complete this analysis, the following 
table summarizes the classes and their associated metrics for QDA and
Random Forest, and the following plot provides a visual comparison of these
performance metrics for QDA and Random Forest:

```

The sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, and F1-Score for Random Forest 
exceed those of QDA for all classes.  Perhaps QDA did not perform as well as 
Random Forest because the degree of normality of the predictors used in 
QDA cross-validation were inadequate.  Alternatively, QDA may be a
more realistic solution compared to Random Forest because QDA is unaffected 
by the class prevalence bias that is expected to exist within the data set, 
where Random Forest does not have the same bias controlling characteristics
(O'Brien & Ishwaran, 2019).

Regardless of the class prevalence bias, as noted previously, balanced accuracy 
and F1-Score are useful as machine learning solution metrics for imbalanced 
data sets because they can evaluate an algorithm in a way that prevalence does 
not cloud the assessment (Irizarry, n.d.).  Therefore, from the bar plots and 
table above, the following performance comparisons between QDA and Random
Forest were drawn: 

* For both balanced accuracy and F1-Score, Random Forest out performed QDA
in classifying Spondylolisthesis with metrics of 0.962 for balanced accuracy
and 0.961 for F1-Score

* For both balanced accuracy and F1-Score, Random Forest out performed QDA
in classifying Normal spine characteristics with metrics of 0.833 for
balanced accuracy and 0.766 for F1-Score;

\newpage

* For both balanced accuracy and F1-Score, Random Forest out performed QDA
in classifying Disk Hernia with metrics of 0.734 for balanced accuracy
and 0.612 for F1-Score

Overall, specificity, sensitivity, balanced accuracy, and F1-Score indicate
that Random Forest better classifies Spondylolisthesis, Normal spine, and
Disk Hernia compared to QDA.

Despite the ability of balanced accuracy and F1-Score to avoid being clouded by
class prevalence, the relationship between real world prevalence of Disk Hernia 
and Spondylolisthesis and this Vertebral Column Data Set has yet to be 
considered.  To attempt to gain a sense of any disparity between real world 
prevalence and the class prevalence in the Vertebral Column Data Set,
secondary research was sought.  According to Dydyk et al. (2022), the prevalence
of Disk Hernia is somewhere in the range of 5 to 20 cases per 1,000, and 
Tenny & Gillis (2022) state that up to 18 percent of lumbar Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) patients present with Spondylolisthesis of various grades.  Although
some prevalence information was found, being able to compare these measures
to those in the Vertebral Column Data Set was difficult, because the secondary
research presented binary classification between Disk Hernia and Normal spine
characteristics and binary classification between Spondylolisthesis and 
Normal spine characteristics, whereas the Vertebral Column Data Set has
three classes.  For this reason, assumptions were required to compare the 
prevalence from secondary research with the prevalence in the Vertebral 
Column Data Set.  For simplicity, the normal classifications within the 
Vertebral Column Data Set were assumed to be representative of the real world,
which left a direct comparison to the secondary research for Disk Hernia
and Spondylolisthesis prevalence.

The following table shows the class percentages from the verification data
(which is approximately the same for the training and test data sets): 

``` {r, prevalence-metrics, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

                position = "center",
                font_size = 8) 





```

The prevalence from the Vertebral Column Data Set shown in the table above 
differs from the values presented by Dydyk et al. (2022) and Tenny & Gillis 
(2022).  More specifically, two percent prevalence for Disk Hernia was noted 
in the secondary research versus 19 percent in the Vertebral Column data, and 
up to 18 percent prevalence for Spondylolisthesis in the secondary research 
(which is based on MRI imagery collected -- true real world prevalence may be 
much smaller as healthy people generally are not subjects of MRI collection) 
versus 48 percent in the Vertebral Column data. Regardless of 
the prior assumption of the Normal class in the Vertebral Column Data Set
being representative of the real world prevalence, the merits of the 
assumption, or others without better real world prevalence data, is weak, and 
therefore, exposes a limitation of this small data set and the ability to 
connect it to real world prevalence.

In addition to real world prevalence, precision also matters given the goal
of determining the feasibility of creating a future medical image 
augmentation system.  Therefore, a summary table for class precision for 
QDA and Random Forest are shown in the table below, and a comparison of 
precision for QDA and Random Forest are shown in the plot below because 
precision matters in medical diagnosis for its ability to quantify the accuracy 
of True Positives (specificity) (Irizarry, n.d.); in other words, the capability
of making a positive diagnosis when a medical condition exists. However, 
precision should be scrutinized due to its limitation of potentially producing 
optimistic values because of its tie to prevalence:

\newpage

Overall, since imbalanced data has the ability to cloud Random Forests decision
making (O'Brien & Ishwaran, 2019), despite Random Forest having better 
performance metrics than QDA, which is believed to be devoid of class 
prevalence effects, given the small data set with limited ability to 
control the class prevalence, and the challenges in mirroring real
world prevalence, as a precautionary approach, QDA was selected as the
most trustworthy model to assess suitability for a future medical image 
augmentation system.

Based on selecting QDA as the preferred machine learning solution, QDA may
provide meaningful augmentation information to medical image assessments based 
on the performance metrics observed for balanced accuracy, F1-Score, and 
precision.  These three metrics were selected because balanced accuracy and 
F1-score incorporate measures of sensitivity and specificity, which are useful 
in quantifying the cost of errors and their characteristics of having relief 
from the clouding of class prevalence, and precision was selected as a 
specificity measure since correctly diagnosing is important in medicine.

Keeping the goal in mind of assessing the potential use of QDA in a future
medical image augmentation system, setting a threshold to determine whether or 
not a method would be valuable for augmentation helps to bring objectivity to 
the assessment.  Therefore, a measure of 0.70 for the mean of balanced 
accuracy, F1-Score, and precision, which can be thought of as ensembling 
metrics relevant for the data characteristics of class prevalence bias and the 
medical use case of considering the cost of errors, was selected as a cut-off 
to judge the predictive utility for the potential use of each class in a 
future medical image augmentation system.  In addition, and in the context of
developing a framework for medical image augmentation systems, the metrics used 
in the assessment ensemble could be weighted by health professionals based on
their specific needs and their approach to diagnostics, which can provide the
level of control that they may desire.

To facilitate the threshold analysis, the means of balanced accuracy, 
F1-Score, and precision for the QDA classifications are shown in the 
following table:

``` {r, compute-qda-means, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

From the table above, the mean score for Spondylolisthesis and Normal spine 
classes met or exceeded the threshold of 0.7, and are therefore, 
recommended for consideration in a future medical image augmentation 
system.  However, the mean score for Disk Hernia did not meet the 0.70 
threshold.  Therefore, QDA Disk Hernia classifications were not recommended 
to be included as an information source within a future future medical image 
augmentation system.

# Conclusion and Future Work

Out of three machine learning solutions of QDA, Random Forest, and KNN used to
predict spine classifications of Disk Hernia, Normal, and Spondylolisthesis,
the accuracy for the cross-validated solutions generated using Random Forest 
and QDA had higher accuracy on the verification data than the preliminary 
test accuracy results, which was evidence that Random Forest and QDA 
did not over fit.  Since the KNN-5 solution produced accuracy on the 
verification set that was three percent lower than the test set, the KNN-5 
solution was categorized as over fit.

In comparing the performance of QDA and Random Forest, Random Forest out 
performed QDA for every metric used to analyze the results.  More specifically, 
these metrics consisted of sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, F1-Score,
and precision.  Despite Random Forest exhibiting better performance than QDA, 
QDA was selected as the most appropriate model to consider for a future medical 
image augmentation system due to the class prevalence characteristics of the 
Vertebral Column Data Set, which invoked the belief that the decision trees 
generated by Random Forest have bias (O'Brien & Ishwaran, 2019) that is less 
controlled compared to QDA.

The class prevalence characteristics of the Vertebral Column Data Set and the
small size of the data set (310 patients) were the major limiting factors in
producing solutions that were free from bias.  More specifically, the class 
prevalence disparity within the Vertebral column Data Set and the difficulty 
ascertaining whether the class prevalence disparity was representative of real 
world prevalence of Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis was one of the major 
contributors to selecting QDA over Random Forest, because QDA
is a version of Naive Bayes that controls for prevalence (Irizarry, 2022, 
Chapter 31).  

Another major factor that influenced selecting QDA over Random Forest was 
discovering that highly imbalanced data has been observed to reduce the 
reliability of Random Forest solutions to generalize well to new data, because 
tree formation within the model may be based on classification error 
(O'Brien & Ishwaran, 2019).  This implied potential for classification error
could make the decisions for tree algorithms non-nonsensical when applied to 
future data that has a different class prevalence.  Although class imbalance 
was evident, stating with confidence whether the imbalanced data is extreme 
enough to render nonsensical decision trees cannot be proven nor
evaluated with this small data set.  Therefore, the conservative decision was
to reject Random Forest until the solution could be retrained and evaluated on a 
larger data set where prevalence could be controlled.

Although opinions may differ between health professionals and data scientists,
a cut-off score for the mean of balanced accuracy, F1-Score and precision of 0.7
was used to determine the classes that would potentially qualify for 
implementation in a future medical image augmentation system.  For the QDA 
solution, a Normal classification achieved a cut-off score of 0.703, 
Spondylolisthesis achieved a cut-off score of 0.816, and Disk Hernia 
achieved a cut-off score of 0.614.  Based on these scores and the threshold, 
Spondylolisthesis and Normal classifications could be considered for use in a 
future medical image augmentation system.  More importantly, in the spirit of
developing a framework for medical image augmentation systems, the metrics used 
in the assessment ensemble could be weighted by health professionals based on
their specific needs and their approach to diagnostics, which could provide the
level of control that they may desire.

Given the foregoing limitations of the small data set size and the class
prevalence issues identified, future work requires a much larger data set
that is representative of the prevalence of Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis
in the real world.  With a data set of sufficient size and real world 
prevalence, Random Forest could potentially be retrained to obtain a reliable, 
effective, and accurate medical decision making model (Podgorelec et al., 2002).
In addition, an opportunity to obtain a more robust data set may present
itself by developing a Shiny web application, where health professionals can
upload imagery and measurements provided patient consent has been obtained. 

Should a Shiny web application be developed, the expanded data set could be 
continually re-trained and evaluated in order to advance this specific 
application along with providing a rich data set that can be used in the 
future for other research.  Potentially, the long term impacts may include, 
advancement in conceptualization and building upon the framework laid out here
for the assessment of machine learning results for medical applications, and 
increased interest in developing augmentation systems.  However, to be clear, 
the goal of creating and promoting machine learning augmentation systems in 
medicine is not to replace the judgment of qualified health 
professionals; as the classification results here show, the predictions are 
by no means perfect.  Instead, the potential benefits include providing a data 
rich environment to assist health professionals, and the construction of 
various data platforms for collecting and gaining insights from medical data 
that in the future can benefit society in new and novel ways.
